    "\n",
    "SageMaker offers distributed training libraries smdistributed to support data and model parallelism. The libraries are optimized for the SageMaker training environment, help adapt your distributed training jobs to SageMaker, and improve training speed and throughput. \n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML) practitioners commonly face two scaling challenges when training models: scaling model size and scaling training data. While model size and complexity can result in better accuracy, there is a limit to the model size you can fit into a single CPU or GPU. Furthermore, scaling model size may result in more computations and longer training times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data parallel is the most common approach to distributed training: You have a lot of data, batch it up, and send blocks of data to multiple CPUs or GPUs (nodes) to be processed by the neural network or ML algorithm, then combine the results. The neural network is the same on each node. A model parallel approach is used with large models that won’t fit in a node’s memory in one piece; it breaks up the model and places different parts on different nodes. In this situation, you need to send your batches of data out to each node so that the data is processed on all parts of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are training with a large dataset, start with a data parallel approach. You can also try the following to improve performance with data parallel:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Change your model’s hyperparameters.\n",
    "* Reduce the batch size.\n",
    "* Keep reducing the batch size until it fits. If you reduce batch size to 1, and still run out of memory, then you should try model-parallel training.\n",
    "* Try gradient compression (FP16, INT8).\n",
    "* Try reducing the input size.\n",
    "* Combine with hyperparameter optimizations (HPO)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you run out of memory during training, you may want to switch to a model parallel approach, or try hybrid model and data parallelism. Start with model-parallel training when:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your model does not fit on a single device.\n",
    "* Due to your model size, you’re facing limitations in choosing larger batch sizes, such as if your model weights take up most of your GPU memory and you are forced to choose a smaller, suboptimal batch size.\n",

    "SageMaker provides distributed training libraries for data parallelism and model parallelism. The libraries are optimized for the SageMaker training environment, help adapt your distributed training jobs to SageMaker, and improve training speed and throughput.\n",
    "\n",

    "### SageMaker Model Parallel\n",
    "\n",
    "Model parallelism is the process of splitting a model up between multiple devices or nodes (such as GPU-equipped instances) and creating an efficient pipeline to train the model across these devices to maximize GPU utilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Increasing deep learning model size (layers and parameters) can result in better accuracy. However, there is a limit to the maximum model size you can fit in a single GPU. When training deep learning models, GPU memory limitations can be a bottleneck in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. They can limit the size of the model you train. Given that larger models tend to achieve higher accuracy, this directly translates to trained model accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. They can limit the batch size you train with, leading to lower GPU utilization and slower training.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome the limitations associated with training a model on a single GPU, you can use model parallelism to distribute and train your model on multiple computing devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core features of SageMaker Model Parallel \n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Automated Model Splitting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-parallel-core-features.html): When you use SageMaker's model parallel library, you can take advantage of automated model splitting, also referred to as automated model partitioning. The library uses a partitioning algorithm that balances memory, minimizes communication between devices, and optimizes performance. You can configure the automated partitioning algorithm to optimize for speed or memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [Pipeline Execution Schedule](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-parallel-core-features.html): A core feature of SageMaker's distributed model parallel library is pipelined execution, which determines the order in which computations are made and data is processed across devices during model training. Pipelining is a technique to achieve true parallelization in model parallelism, by having the GPUs compute simultaneously on different data samples, and to overcome the performance loss due to sequential computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pipelining is based on splitting a mini-batch into microbatches, which are fed into the training pipeline one-by-one and follow an execution schedule defined by the library runtime. A microbatch is a smaller subset of a given training mini-batch. The pipeline schedule determines which microbatch is executed by which device for every time slot.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to its [core features](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-parallel-core-features.html), the SageMaker distributed model parallel library offers [memory-saving features](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-parallel-extended-features-pytorch.html) for training deep learning models with PyTorch: [tensor parallelism](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-parallel-extended-features-pytorch-tensor-parallelism.html), [optimizer state sharding](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-parallel-extended-features-pytorch-optimizer-state-sharding.html), [activation checkpointing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-parallel-extended-features-pytorch-activation-checkpointing.html), and [activation offloading](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-parallel-extended-features-pytorch-activation-offloading.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "### SageMaker Model Parallel configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Please refer to all the [configuration parameters](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/training/smd_model_parallel_general.html) related to SageMaker Distributed Training.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we are going to use PyTorch and Hugging Face for training GPT-J, it is important to understand all the SageMaker Distributed configuration parameters specific to PyTorch [here](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/training/smd_model_parallel_general.html#pytorch-specific-parameters).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important\n",
    "\n",
    "`process_per_host` must not be greater than the number of GPUs per instance and typically will be equal to the number of GPUs per instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you use one instance with 4-way pipeline parallelism and 2-way data parallelism, then processes_per_host should be 2 x 4 = 8. Therefore, you must choose an instance that has at least 8 GPUs, such as an ml.p3.16xlarge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following image illustrates how 4-way data parallelism and 2-way pipeline parallelism is distributed across 8 GPUs: the models is partitioned across 2 GPUs, and each partition is added to 4 GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also important to understand how the [ranking mechanism](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-parallel-extended-features-pytorch-ranking-mechanism.html) of model parallelism works with tensor parallelism. This is extended from the Ranking Basics for Core Features of the SageMaker Model Parallel Library.\n",
