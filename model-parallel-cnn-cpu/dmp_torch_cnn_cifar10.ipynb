It is inteneded to run a live workshop for SageMaker distributed training with limited time and constrained resource. The training job runs on a single node with multiple vCPUs such as ml.c5.2xlarge.

    "Model parallelism allows partitioning a large deep learning model across multiple devices, within or across instances during training. Increasing the size of deep learning models (layers and parameters) yields better accuracy for complex tasks such as computer vision and natural language processing. However, there is a limit to the maximum model size you can fit in the memory of a single GPU. When training DL models, GPU memory limitations can be bottlenecks in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "* They limit the size of the model you can train, since the memory footprint of a model scales proportionally to the number of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "* They limit the per-GPU batch size during training, driving down GPU utilization and training efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome the limitations associated with training a model on a single GPU, SageMaker provides the model parallel library to help distribute and train DL models efficiently on multiple compute nodes. Furthermore, with the library, you can achieve most optimized distributed training using EFA-supported devices, which enhance the performance of inter-node communication with low latency, high throughput, and OS bypass.\n",

    "* An FP32 copy of gradient ~ 4 bytes (needed for the OA operation)\n",
    "\n",
    "Even for a relatively small DL model with 10 billion parameters, it can require at least 200GB of memory, which is much larger than the typical GPU memory (for example, NVIDIA A100 with 40GB/80GB memory and V100 with 16/32 GB) available on a single GPU. Note that on top of the memory requirements for model and optimizer states, there are other memory consumers such as activations generated in the forward pass. The memory required can be a lot greater than 200GB.\n",
